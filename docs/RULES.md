The full list of linter checks. This file is extended as rules are added; the live list at
runtime is `xbsl --list-rules` (or the MCP `list_rules`). Currently there are 87 rules.

## Boundary: the linter complements the compiler, it does not replace it

The linter works over text, the AST and the project model. Its rules know types at the first
hop: the declared nominal type of a variable and its members, the project objects and the
types they generate, enumeration values, the global types of the linked libraries (from the
`.xlib` archive) - but they do not infer the type of an expression. The engine does infer
chain types, only that feeds hover and completion in the editor, not the checks.

Some of the findings the compiler would catch as well: an unknown type, an argument count, a
non-exception in `поймать`, a return not matching the signature. The linter's value there is
not that it sees more, but that it sees them **earlier** - in seconds on your own machine,
before the build and the deploy, pointing at the exact spot. The rest the compiler never
checks at all: code-writing conventions, typography, project structure (duplicate `Ид`,
file pairing), unused variables, secrets in the sources.

What the linter does not do is anything that needs full inference of expression types: a
redundant cast, an unclosed resource, whether the TYPE of a returned value matches the
signature. That last one is worth separating: a structural mismatch (a value in a void
method, a bare `возврат` in a typed one) is caught by `code/return-mismatch`, while a
`возврат` of a string from a method declared `: Число` slips through - telling that apart
needs the expression's type.

Code correctness is verified by the server-side compilation on deploy; the linter runs before
it and removes common mistakes early.

## How to read the table

- **Rule** – the `group/name` identifier. The group (the part before `/`) lets you enable and
  disable rules in bulk.
- **Severity** – `error` (a build/CI should fail), `warning` (a convention is broken),
  `info` (a hint, usually off).
- **Default** – whether the rule is in the default set (`on`) or is enabled explicitly (`off`).
- **Scope** – `file` (the rule sees one file) or `project` (needs the whole-project index:
  duplicate Ids, unknown types, cross-module calls).
- **Docs** – a link to the platform documentation section behind the rule. In VS Code the code
  of such a rule in the Problems panel opens that section right in the editor.

## Tiers

Rules are split into tiers A-D by what they rely on. A tier is also a quick filter for
`--select`/`--ignore` (alongside the group and the identifier): `--select A,B` runs only
structure and text, `--ignore D` drops the semantics over stdlib.

### Tier A - structure and YAML

The file exists, parses, the object has a unique UUID, the name matches the file.

| Rule | Severity | Default | Scope | What it checks | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `yaml/valid` | error | on | file | YAML does not parse | – |
| `yaml/id-uuid` | error | on | file | Ид is not a UUID | – |
| `yaml/id-required` | warning | on | file | The object has no Ид | – |
| `yaml/name-matches-file` | warning | on | file | Имя does not match the file name | – |
| `yaml/id-unique` | error | on | project | Duplicate Ид in the project | – |
| `project/identifier` | warning | on | file | Project name or vendor is not an identifier | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/project-properties-standard/) |
| `project/presentation` | warning | on | file | Project presentation is empty | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/project-properties-standard/) |
| `project/version` | warning | on | file | Project version is not A.B.C | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/project-properties-standard/) |
| `structure/xbsl-pair` | warning | on | file | Module .xbsl without a paired .yaml | – |

### Tier B - text and conventions

Encoding, newlines, whitespace, typography (dashes, quotes, ellipsis), line length, secrets
in the sources.

| Rule | Severity | Default | Scope | What it checks | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `security/hardcoded-secret` | error | on | file | A key or a password as a literal | – |
| `typography/em-dash` | info | off | file | Em dash in a comment | – |

### Tier C - code structure, basic syntax and code-writing conventions

Block and bracket balance, loop and method headers, local variables and the `style/` group -
conventions from the documentation section "Code-writing recommendations". Some `style/` rules
are off by default (accumulated debt, `info`): enable them with `--select style` to measure.

## Group details

### Queries: `IN` with a subquery over a composite type (rule `query/in-subquery-composite`)

A platform standard: `IN` with a subquery over an expression of a composite type is implemented
inefficiently on most DBMSs, so the condition is written with `EXISTS` instead. The rule is a
warning – the standard is mandatory:

```
WHERE T.Value IN (SELECT F.Value FROM Filters AS F)                    // warning
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Filters AS F WHERE F.Value = T.Value)      // this way
```

A type counts as composite when the yaml spells two or more alternatives (`Строка|Число|?`): the
`?` is not a type but the admissibility of `Неопределено`, and `Массив<Строка|Число>` is not
composite either. Only a field whose type is known for sure is questioned: `Alias.Field` or
`Table.Field`, where the alias is unambiguous within the block and the field is found in the
table's yaml; a list of values (`IN (1, 2, &Codes)`) is not what the standard is about. Both
spellings of the query language are understood (`В`/`IN`, `НЕ`/`NOT`, `ВЫБРАТЬ`/`SELECT`).

### Project properties (the `project/` rules)

Three rules from the standard "Filling in the project properties": `Поставщик` and `Имя` are
identifiers built from the presentations (every word capitalized: `КабинетСотрудника`,
`НовыеЭлементарныеТехнологии`); `Представление` and `ПредставлениеПоставщика` are filled in – the
official name of the project and of the company that developed it; `Версия` is three numbers
`A.B.C` (semantic versioning), not `1.0`.

### Names of project elements (the `naming/` rules)

Twelve rules from the platform standard "Names of project elements" – it is mandatory in new code,
so all of them are warnings. They read the descriptions (`.yaml`): the name of the element itself
and the names of its attributes, dimensions, resources, tabular sections and enumeration values.

The number of a name is checked against the kind: catalogs, documents, registers and tabular
sections are named in the plural, enumerations and structures in the singular (`naming/number`).
This is morphology, not a guess by the ending: `Номенклатура` is singular and the standard allows
it, while `Программы` and `Акции` without the case read as a genitive singular. Needs the `[morph]`
extra (`pip install "xbsl[morph]"`); without it the rule stays silent.

The rest: the letter `ё` and underscores in names, an abbreviation written as one word (`Ндс`, not
`НДС`), an English term as the original (`Xml`, not `Хмл`), `Вид` rather than `Тип` for
enumerations, the kind inside its own name (`ОтчетЗависшиеЗадачи`), filler words (`Управление`,
`Менеджер`), an environment suffix on a common module (`ОбменДаннымиКлиентИСервер` – the
environment is a property, not a name), a boolean attribute named by a negation (`НетОшибок`
instead of `Успешно`), an empty `Представление`, and the prefixes required for certain kinds
(`КлючДоступа`, `ПравоНа`, `Навигация`).

### Code style conventions (the `style/` rules)

Twenty-one rules that follow the platform documentation ("Code style conventions" and "Language
idioms"): layout and expression wrapping, naming, type descriptions and signatures, collection
literals, string interpolation, and checks of boolean values and `Неопределено`.

Rules that clean code already satisfies are enabled by default (`warning`) – they guard against
regressions. Rules that typically fire on accumulated legacy debt are `info` and disabled; enable
them to measure the debt and pay it down:

```sh
xbsl path/to/sources --select style     # ONLY these rules (replaces the default set)
xbsl path/to/sources --enable style     # the default set PLUS these
xbsl path/to/sources --ignore style     # the default set minus these
```

`--select`, `--enable` and `--ignore` accept a rule id, a group (the part before `/`) or a tier
letter, repeated or comma-separated. `--select` narrows to exactly the given rules; `--enable`
switches on off-by-default rules on top of the defaults.

`Запрос{ ... }` blocks (the query DSL) and string literals (HTML/CSS/SVG in web views) are
excluded from these checks. Not covered, and left to the author and review: indentation being a
multiple of four, collection idioms, `Строки.Соединить()` for bulk concatenation, the `?.` / `??`
idioms, and `выбор` instead of an `иначе если` chain.

## Enabling and disabling

`--select` and `--ignore` accept a rule identifier, a group (the part before `/`, e.g. `style`)
or a tier letter `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`. A plugin may override a rule's severity (the `xbsl.severity`
entry-points group); `XBSL_NO_PLUGINS=1` disables plugins and restores the built-in values from
this table.
